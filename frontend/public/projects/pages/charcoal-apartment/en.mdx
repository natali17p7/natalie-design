This apartment interior is designed as a tranquil, intimate, monochrome retreat.  

The mood is calm and immersive, created through a palette of soft greys, deep charcoals, 
and warm neutral tones. Materials are carefully balanced: glossy surfaces and tinted glass elements are paired with rich fabrics and textured wall panels, resulting in an environment that feels both modern and cozy.  

Subtle design accents — integrated LED panels, delicate string-like furniture details, and ambient warm glass lighting — add depth and a sophisticated glow throughout the space.  


The main area is organized into two contrasting yet harmonious zones: a striking black kitchen defined by dark stone and smoked glass, and a bright, light-filled living space with soft textiles and gentle, sculptural forms. This division creates a dynamic visual rhythm while maintaining an overall sense of unity.  


In the bedrooms, soft upholstered wall panels serve as generous headboards, enhancing comfort and contributing to the calm aesthetic. The primary bedroom is divided into two functional zones: a wardrobe area positioned closer to the window for natural light, and a sleeping area tucked deeper into the room.  

Overall, the design creates a refined, soothing atmosphere where modern lines, tactile materials, and thoughtful lighting come together to form an elegant and deeply livable home.
