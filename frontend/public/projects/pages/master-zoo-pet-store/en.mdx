The design of stores aims to create a lively and vivid customer experience, to bring stores into line with the insinuating brand, as well as to bring the sentiment inherent in pet ownership of pet-owning, such as advertising messages on behalf of pets.

The project was developed taking into account future adaptation to several hundred retail outlets of the chain of stores.

Trading equipment was developed taking into account ease of use and suitability for the brand's product range. A lot of equipment is modular, which diversifies the variability of its use.

The project includes the creation of unique trading equipment, navigation, POS materials and decorations. It also contains drawings and descriptions of the logic of using elements in different premises.
