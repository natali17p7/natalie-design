The goal of the project was to change consumer perception of the chain of stores. It was necessary to emphasize the store’s wide range of the products and low price category, yet to make it stylish, welcoming and pleasant to be in.

The light color scheme provides a pleasant base for a huge variety of products, the wood texture makes the interior cozier and red accents highlight the most important details.

One of the goals was to place a large amount of goods, but at the same time make the store feel spacious and uncluttered. Custom equipment was designed for effective product placement and convenient use by employees.
For easy orientation in a large space a navigation system has been developed.
Promotional elements and large images attract attention to the new products and favorable offers.

Created in partnership with Sicore Group.
