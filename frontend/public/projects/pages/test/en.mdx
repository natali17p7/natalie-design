The concept of the training camp of the Ecuadorian football club "Cumbre Alta".

The task of the project was to place the required number of training fields, tennis courts, 
an apartment building and a multi-functional building with training and rehabilitation rooms, lounge areas, restaurants, offices.

The wing-shaped roof echoes the club's logo, openwork design around the building provides plenty of natural light in the interior spaces. Diverse tropical planting creates picturesque zones for recreation and games viewing.
