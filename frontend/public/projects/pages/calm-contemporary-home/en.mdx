The project embodies a calm, contemporary aesthetic where soft minimalism meets functional comfort. 
A special feature of the home is its ability to balance design and practicality. Every material and detail was chosen with durability and easy maintenance in mind—a key requirement from the client. 

The open-plan kitchen and living area are designed for effortless everyday living. 
Sleek cabinetry, a monolithic stone island, and understated decorative lighting establish a clean architectural rhythm. The suspended planter shelf introduces an organic touch.
The living room centers around a textured stone fireplace and a custom media wall, combining sculptural elegance with hidden storage solutions. 

The staircase zone becomes a statement piece with bold color blocking, textured stone panels, and a playful wavy mirror that adds personality to the otherwise architectural composition.

A refined palette of warm neutrals, charcoal tones, and terracotta accents runs throughout the home, creating a cohesive atmosphere that feels both modern and inviting. Natural textures—stone, wood, and matte finishes—add depth and sophistication without overwhelming the space.
