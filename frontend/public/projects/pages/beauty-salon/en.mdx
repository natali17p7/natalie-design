This beauty salon interior is designed as a modern, uplifting space where clean geometry meets soft feminine accents. A palette of matte black elements, warm coral panels, and soft white furnishings creates a balanced atmosphere that feels both stylish and inviting. 

Custom workstation frames with integrated lighting add architectural rhythm, while open shelving displays products as part of the design.
